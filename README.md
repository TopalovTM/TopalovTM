- 👋 Hi, I’m @TopalovTM and I am currently a student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.
- 👀 I’m interested in finding creative solutions and enhancing my problem solving skills. My focus is on OOD concepts, but I am always open to learning new and exciting tools 
in order to tackle challenges and keep up with the technological trends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring and am focused on applying the OOD concepts in Java and C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking for opportunities to be able to apply what I have learned so far in professional environment and to contribute with my work towards something useful. I have yet
a lot to learn and practice, but I am motivated to make my journey as challenging and interesting as possible.
- 📫 How to reach me: Easiest way on my mobile: +359885521429 or my email: tmtopalov@gmail.com
